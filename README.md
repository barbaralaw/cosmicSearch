I'm creating this game solo as a part of Mintbean.io's weekly hackathon.

It is very much a work in progress, and I am a beginner. The game's mechanics and board layout are borrowed from our family's favorite (and unfortunately discontinued )board game, "Scooby Doo! Fright at the Fun Park" by Buffalo Games & Puzzles. I make no claim of ownership to the mechanics or board layout.
