# cosmicSearch

Hi there!

I've created this game solo as part of a weeklong hackathon hosted by mintbean.io .

It was purposely built using only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a learning and practice experience for me with those languages. 

Cosmic Search's mechanics and board layout are borrowed from our family's favorite (and unfortunately discontinued )board game, "Scooby Doo! Fright at the Fun Park" by Buffalo Games & Puzzles. I make no claim of ownership to the mechanics or board layout, and I thank whoever the original game designer was for this fantastic game! 

The game is a work in progress, and I have a list of features I would like to add in time:

  - Multi-screen functionality using socket.io or similar
  - Add a warning countdown before secret information is revealed in single screen mode
  - An editable mini-map for each player where they can note the information they've gleaned from collected clues
  - More visual ticket cards for added interest and to allow younger players to fully participate
  

Thanks for checking out my first game project!
